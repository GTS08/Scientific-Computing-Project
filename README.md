# Scientific Computing Project

## About the project

This project is part of the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department (CEID) of University of Patras curriculum.

The goal of the project was to implement different scientific computing algorithms in Matlab.

## Exercises

1. Report tools and hardware that were used to solve the exercises.
2. Implement Block Compressed Row Storage (BCRS) algorithm.
3. Calculate number of possible paths between two nodes given an adjacency matrix.
4. Calculate bandedness of a band matrix.
5. Extract diagrams from different algorithms.

* **Note**: Since there was no actual code written in the first exercise, there is no folder representing the exercise.
